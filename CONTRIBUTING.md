Function style and docstrings should follow numpy idioms where possible.
Examples can be found in existing functions.

The current convention is to have one function per file.
A shorter alias function can be added to the same file (eg. `plot_complex()` and `plotc()`).

Ideally each function should have a test in the `tests/` directory.

Thanks!
